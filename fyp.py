    ## Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System (DR AZLIZA & DR FAIZAL) üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About Us

    ### About Dataset
    This study investigates the application of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automate the classification of paddy leaf diseases, 
    addressing a significant challenge in agriculture. Six common diseases (bacterial leaf blight, bacterial leaf streak, brown spot, dead heart, hispa, and leaf blast) 
    were targeted using a curated dataset enriched through augmentation techniques and analysed with exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    ### Content
    1. Train (4800 Images)
    2. Validation (1200 Images)
